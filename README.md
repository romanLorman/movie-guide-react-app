# MovieGuide React App

This React App was created using a wide range of fundamental React technologies and adaptive design, without the use of additional libraries like Bootstrap or Materialize CSS. For development, I utilized the open OMDb API database. However, to add the additional "collection" functionality, I had to leverage the capabilities of local storage. I understand that such an approach is not entirely correct and is ideally implemented through interaction with a backend by extending the API. But this application is educational, and I decided to showcase my understanding of how React works and the ability to synchronize app data with the browser's storage.

## Building the app
  1. Get your API from [OMDb API](https://www.omdbapi.com/)
  2. Follow to movie-guide-react-app-main/src/config.js and assign your OMDb key value to "export const API_KEY" insted of "process.env.REACT_APP_API_KEY"
